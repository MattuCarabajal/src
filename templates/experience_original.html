                                The first two month at GlobalHitss I was doing manual testing on the development of an inside online app, being in parallel who was in charge of starting the automation on it.<br>
                                During that time I was also in charge of the tutelage of a new QA colleague in the team, in her final probationary period at the company academy.<br><br>

                                After those two month I was moved to another project that was focused on an app for Smart TVs.<br>
                                In the lead of the investigation to create and install apps on a set of Smart TVs and STBs, making the base documentation to work with them.<br>
                                At the same time I was also investigating the automation of those TVs.<br>
                                After 2 months a new QA team member was included, from the same Company academy, and was also in charge of her tutelage.<br>
                                For 3 months I was also an interim Functional Analyst for the project until an Analyst was hired.<br>
                                And for 2 months I did exercise as the "leader" for the team until we were assigned to a new PO.<br>
                                Also I did created and updated Test Cases and Reports.<br><br>

                                After 1 year and 6 months the entire team was moved to create a video streaming app for Roku devices and we were given a period to research the technology.<br>
                                By QA, we decided to automate the devices through Selenium WebDriver, developing with Python and Robot Framework, so we focused on learning those languages.<br>
                                We got to implement it and we ran manual and automated testing in parallel.<br><br>
